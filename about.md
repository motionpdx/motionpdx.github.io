RubyMotion lets you quickly develop cross-platform native apps for iOS, Android and OS X, all using your favorite editor and the awesome Ruby language you know and love.

We are a group of RubyMotion enthusiasts. We enjoy building mobile apps with RubyMotion and want to share our knowledge with the rest of the community.

Join us for presentations, demos, discussions, and help getting started with RubyMotion.

Visit our [MotionPDX Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/MotionPDX/) page for more information about our next meetup, or chat with us online in our [RubyMotion Slack Channel](https://motioneers.herokuapp.com/).
